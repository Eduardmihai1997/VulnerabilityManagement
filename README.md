<h1>NESSUS-Vulnerability Management</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab I will cover vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.



<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>VMWare Workstation Player</b> 
- <b>Windows 10 ISO</b> 
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2> 

- <b>Creating a virtual machine in VMWare Workstation Player</b>
- <b>Ensure connectivity with VM</b>

<br />
<br />
[Remediaton] To eliminate this vulnerability, we added and enabled a key registry value (EnableCertPaddingCheck) and additionally, on 64 Bit OS systems, a key registry value (EnableCertPaddingCheck) was added an enabled.<br/>

<br />
Medium Vulnerability Found (SMB Signing not required)  An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server.<br/>

To reduce the risk, SMB1 was disabled using PowerShell utility since SMB1 protocol is labeled as insecure. In addition, it is recommended to disable SMB2 or some other protocol that is not being used and thus reduce the attack surface.  <br/>
